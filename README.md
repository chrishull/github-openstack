The OpenStack Configuration Service: Pluto
Installation, expansion and configuration management is a long avoided pain point in the OpenStack world. 
Pluto addresses this.

What is Pluto for OpenStack

Pluto is a command line tool for managing OpenStack configuration files (soon to be a service which runs 
across all hosts in a cluster). It allows you to view and edit these files in a familiar OpenStack command 
line like way. Pluto keeps an audit trail of your changes within the files. The tool was designed to allow 
you to easily install new versions of OpenStack based on the instructions provided for each release. Batch 
files follow the identical syntax found in the OpenStack install guide. Use of these files is faster and 
far less error prone than manual file editing. See samples and readme.

Database support coming soon. This will allow full configuration synchronization with one single tool.
